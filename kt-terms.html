							<h3>Cancellation and Modifications</h3>
							
							<h4>Unforeseen Cancellation</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>If the event is canceled due to dangerous situations, or conditions beyond the control of the Customer or Kasama Tastings (e.g., inclement weather, travel accidents, or similar unforeseen events), all parties agree to reschedule the event under the same terms as the original agreement.</li>
								<li>If rescheduling is not possible within 6 months of the original event date, the event will be canceled. No refund will be issued for any deposits made, but no additional charges will apply.</li>
