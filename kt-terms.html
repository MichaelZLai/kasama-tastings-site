						<div class="terms-intro">
							<p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") explain the relationship between you ("Customer") and Kasama Tastings ("Kasama Tastings," "us," "our" or "we") regarding your use of, and access to, our website located at kasamatastings.com ("Website") and the features and functionality thereof ("Service" or "Event"). These Terms, which include our Privacy Policy, govern your access to and use of the Website, Service/Event and Content (as defined below), and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Kasama Tastings.</p>
							
							<p class="acknowledgment"><strong>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE, OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</strong></p>

							<h3>Cancellation and Modifications</h3>
							
							<h4>Unforeseen Cancellation</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>If the event is canceled due to dangerous situations, or conditions beyond the control of the Customer or Kasama Tastings (e.g., inclement weather, travel accidents, or similar unforeseen events), all parties agree to reschedule the event under the same terms as the original agreement.</li>
								<li>If rescheduling is not possible within 6 months of the original event date, the event will be canceled. No refund will be issued for any deposits made, but no additional charges will apply.</li>
								<li>If an event is interrupted or prevented from occurring for reasons stated above, Kasama Tastings is excused from its obligations. Kasama Tastings may provide a partial refund at its discretion, depending on costs already incurred. This refund, if offered, will be the Customer's sole remedy.</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Cancellation by Customer</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>If the Customer cancels the service more than 7 days before the event date, the Customer will receive a full refund.</li>
								<li>Cancellations made within 7 days of the event will incur a charge of 50% of the total cost.</li>
								<li>Rescheduling is treated as a cancellation, with replacement date terms subject to negotiation and possible additional costs.</li>
								<li>For events without a specific date designated in the initial agreement, no refunds or credits are issued, and the full balance becomes due upon cancellation.</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Cancellation by Kasama Tastings</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Kasama Tastings reserves the right to cancel or adjust timing of the event at any time if conditions arise that could prevent the event from being safe or successful. In such cases, any fees paid will be refunded to the Customer, limiting Kasama Tastings' liability to the amount of fees collected.</li>
								<li>Until the Customer has signed and returned the agreement with all sections completed, this document serves only as a proposal and is not legally binding.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<div class="terms-section">
							<h3>Acknowledgment of Risk and Liability</h3>
