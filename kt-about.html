								<p class="bio-text">My wine journey started as a curious student at UVA (Go Hoos!) exploring the beautiful wineries of Charlottesville, VA. Back then, every sip tasted like... well, grapes. But I was hooked on the experience!</p>
								
								<p class="bio-text">After college, life got a little science-yâ€”I became a high school Chemistry and Physics teacher. Let's just say my wine consumption skyrocketed (teaching is no joke)! I wanted to drink smarter, not just more, so I dove headfirst into learning about wine, especially on a teacher's budget.</p>
								
								<p class="bio-text">I took my wine studies to the next level and after attaining my Advanced Certificate with merit from the Wine & Spirits Education Trust, I knew there was a ton of wine knowledge to share with the world.</p>
								
								<p class="bio-text">I firmly believe that everyone, regardless of their relationship with alcohol, should be able to explore and enjoy the world of wine. The thriving wine and sober-curious communities in Austin inspired me to create a space where both could come together. I started Kasama Tastings to make wine education fun, exciting, accessible and most importantly inclusive for friends with various relationships with wine.</p>
